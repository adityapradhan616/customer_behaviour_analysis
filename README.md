# customer_behaviour_analysis
# Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data loading, exploration, cleaning, querying, visualization, and reporting. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from raw data and present them clearly through SQL analysis, dashboards, and professional reports.
The project highlights practical skills in Python, SQL, Power BI, and business-focused communication.

# Dataset

  The dataset is loaded and processed using Python
  Contains structured data suitable for exploratory data analysis and SQL querying
  Cleaned to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats
  (Dataset source and description can be added here if applicable)

# Tools & Technologies

  Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)
  SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)
  Power BI (Dashboard creation and data visualization)
  Gamma (Presentation / PPT creation)
  Jupyter Notebook / VS Code (Development environment)
